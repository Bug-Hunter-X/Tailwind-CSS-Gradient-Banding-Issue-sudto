# Tailwind CSS Gradient Banding Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients where using colors too far apart in the spectrum, or with significant differences in brightness/saturation, can lead to jarring or banded gradients.  The issue is more pronounced on certain browsers and screen resolutions.

## Problem

The `bg-gradient-to-r` utility in Tailwind CSS is used to create linear gradients.  However, when colors with stark differences are used, a banding effect can occur, compromising the visual quality of the gradient.

## Solution

The solution involves careful color selection.  Try using colors that are closer together on the color spectrum or have similar brightness and saturation levels.  Alternatively, exploring different gradient types (radial or conic) or using a gradient generator tool can aid in finding visually appealing combinations.
