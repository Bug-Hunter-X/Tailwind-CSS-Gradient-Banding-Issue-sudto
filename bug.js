```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature, `bg-gradient-to-r`, which generates a linear gradient from left to right. However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too far apart on the color spectrum, or have very different brightness/saturation, it might cause unexpected visual issues.  The gradient may appear jarring or have unexpected banding, especially on certain browsers or screen resolutions.
